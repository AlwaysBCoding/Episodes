Setup info:

1. install http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/

1.1 - allow the program in firewalls etc. if used on network or internet.

1.2 - run and configure your program accordingly (works pretty much out of the box)

1.3 - one configuration you might want to keep an eye on is: "Automatically pause growl when a fullscreen application is running" - depending on your toast pleasure!

2. keep growlnotify.com / growlnotify.exe in the same folder (or add to path, your choice)

3. use the bot and all your messages will be toasted.




Additional : info

jb.png - icon displayed nexto toast message in growl for windows
testmsg.bat - syntax for displaying toasted messages in commandline outside of bot usage.
